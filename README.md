# ttcat

A command line Twitter client

I created this app while taking a pluralsight course "Building Command Line Applications in Node.js"
You can install the latest version by running npm install @collinewait/ttcat.

To use the ttcat CLI:

- Login and create an application on [developer.twitter.com/apps](https://developer.twitter.com/apps)
- Run ttcat configure consumer and enter your application's consumer key and secret
- Run ttcat configure account and follow the instructions
- Run ttcat lookup [screen_name] to try looking up a Twitter user
